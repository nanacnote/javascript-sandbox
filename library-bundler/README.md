# create-package-app

Typescript ready scaffolding for writing and publishing libraries. It comes packaged with an automated & customizable documentation website generator. This allows you to focus on writing code just for your library instead of doing all the other setup stuff.

The generated website is configured to be hosted on GitHub pages and seamlessly integrates with your GitHub repo.

A Docker file is already included to allow for easy collaboration in containers regardless of local dev setup of collaborators.

Testing is also configured with Jest.
